                        While flying the cargo, a terrorist group led by Dani Nakamura (played by Karen
                        Fukuhara) boards their spaceship, and things get turned upside down as they land on the
                        surface of Callisto. With Dani and Jacob the only
                        survivors, they are taken to Black Iron Prison on the orders of the warden.
                        >After the painful prison admission process,
                        Jacob wakes up to see that the prison has been overrun by prisoners with an
                        unknown disease, and now he must survive this horror, and try to get out of
                        prison in any way. My problem with the
                        game's story is that it's weak from start to finish.
                        >The first 4 hours of the game (about
                        33% of it) are spent being ordered to do some similar things, and when
                        the story finally starts to take a step forward, it's a weak step that
                        doesn't really do anything. By
                        reaching the end of the game, we discover the person behind the
                        outbreak of this unknown disease, and frankly its causes are Cliche
                        and we have witnessed many similarities in other movies or games.
                        In general, the story of The
                        Callisto Protocol, which lasts for more than 10 hours, aims to
                        build a completely new world that will be developed in the
                        future. Although there
                        are some good moments in the game, it's not the best thing
                        overall. If you want
                        to enjoy a strong story in this world, I advise you to
                        listen to the Helix Station podcast, which tells what
                        happened before the events of the game.
                        >This podcast has a
                        story that is much stronger than the game itself!
